Welcome to the arena! chose a champion and do battle against foes. Choose carefully, as your life depends on defeating them all. 

## Description of Play
The player choses one of 4 characters to be their champion. Each character has a special ability, listed on their card. The player then chooses their first opponent and they battle until one of them is defeated. If the player won, they continue on choosing new opponents until they have none left or are defeated themselves.

## Purpose
This was an assignment for coding bootcamp focusing on jquery DOM manipulation. I added the use of classes and more complex bootstrap objects.

## Potential Future Updates
- Fancy animations when doing battle (health numbers flashing or cards shaking).
- display an image of the chosen pokemon when it is guessed (much like the cartoon).
- better surrounding design (I was happy with the cards but not the rest.
- Better responsivenes (the cards are fragile to screen size changes).

## Feedback
Bootstrap is getting easier to use. I found changing the html of jquery generated objects fiddly at times. I often had to fall back to re creating the object to get the changes I wanted displayed.

I welcome any feedback on the choices I made (especially on the html and css side).
